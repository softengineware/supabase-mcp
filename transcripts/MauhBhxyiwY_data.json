recently<00:02:21.160><c> but</c><00:02:21.360><c> many</c><00:02:21.599><c> countries</c><00:02:21.959><c> around</c><00:02:22.200><c> the</c> recently but many countries around the recently but many

some quite notable AI regulations earlier<00:02:31.480><c> uh</c><00:02:31.640><c> this</c><00:02:31.800><c> year</c><00:02:32.000><c> in</c> earlier uh this year in earlier uh this year in 2024<00:02:34.000><c> so</c><00:02:34.680><c> basically</c><00:02:35.680><c> um</c><00:02:35.920><c> they've</c><00:02:36.120><c> just</c> 2024 so basically um they've just 2024 so basically um they've just recently<00:02:36.760><c> passed</c><00:02:37.080><c> this</c><00:02:37.360><c> AI</c><00:02:37.959><c> act</c><00:02:38.560><c> so</c><00:02:38.720><c> you</c><00:02:38.800><c> can</c>

they've</c><00:03:09.680><c> basically</c> technology and what they've basically technology and what they've basically done<00:03:10.360><c> here</c><00:03:10.599><c> is</c><00:03:10.920><c> they've</c><00:03:11.480><c> um</c><00:03:11.640><c> assumed</c><00:03:12.000><c> a</c><00:03:12.200><c> risk</c> done here is they've um assumed a risk done here is they've um assumed a risk

approach so what this means is uh based approach so what this means is that<00:03:16.280><c> um</c><00:03:16.400><c> if</c><00:03:16.519><c> you're</c><00:03:16.680><c> developing</c><00:03:17.159><c> an</c><00:03:17.319><c> AI</c> that um if you're developing an AI that um if you're developing an AI Solution<00:03:18.239><c> that's</c><00:03:18.720><c> either</c><00:03:19.040><c> for</c><00:03:19.519><c> a</c><00:03:19.799><c> high-risk</c> Solution that's either for a high-risk Solution that's either for a high-risk area<00:03:21.120><c> such</c><00:03:21.319><c> as</c><00:03:21.560><c> like</c><00:03:21.760><c> for</c><00:03:21.920><c> example</c><00:03:22.480><c> education</c> area such as like for example education area such as like for example education law<00:03:23.920><c> enforcement</c><00:03:25.000><c> migration</c><00:03:26.000><c> um</c><00:03:26.200><c> anything</c> law enforcement migration um anything law enforcement migration um anything like<00:03:26.840><c> this</c><00:03:27.400><c> they're</c><00:03:27.599><c> subject</c><00:03:27.920><c> to</c><00:03:28.159><c> like</c><00:03:28.400><c> more</c> like this they're subject to like more like this they're subject to like more scrutiny<00:03:29.920><c> these</c><00:03:30.080><c> AI</c><00:03:30.400><c> models</c><00:03:31.319><c> so</c><00:03:32.000><c> um</c><00:03:32.400><c> also</c><00:03:32.680><c> in</c> scrutiny these AI models so um also in scrutiny these AI models so um also in terms<00:03:33.080><c> of</c><00:03:33.760><c> uh</c><00:03:34.760><c> unacceptable</c><00:03:35.599><c> risk</c><00:03:36.319><c> so</c><00:03:36.959><c> um</c><00:03:37.400><c> the</c> terms of uh unacceptable risk so um the terms of uh unacceptable risk so um the idea<00:03:37.959><c> here</c><00:03:38.120><c> is</c><00:03:38.280><c> that</c><00:03:38.400><c> they're</c><00:03:38.599><c> checking</c><00:03:38.920><c> to</c> idea here is that they're checking to idea here is that they're checking to see<00:03:39.239><c> if</c><00:03:39.360><c> the</c><00:03:39.519><c> systems</c><00:03:39.920><c> could</c><00:03:40.080><c> potentially</c> see if the systems could potentially see if the systems could potentially manipulate<00:03:41.799><c> um</c><00:03:42.120><c> Behavior</c><00:03:43.120><c> exploit</c> manipulate um Behavior exploit manipulate um Behavior exploit vulnerabilities<00:03:45.000><c> or</c><00:03:45.959><c> perhaps</c><00:03:46.319><c> mislead</c><00:03:46.959><c> or</c> vulnerabilities or perhaps mislead or vulnerabilities or perhaps mislead or cause<00:03:48.000><c> confusion</c><00:03:48.560><c> at</c><00:03:48.879><c> like</c><00:03:49.000><c> a</c><00:03:49.159><c> huge</c><00:03:49.439><c> scale</c><00:03:50.360><c> so</c> cause confusion at like a huge scale so cause confusion at like a huge scale so this<00:03:50.920><c> is</c><00:03:51.120><c> their</c><00:03:51.360><c> approach</c><00:03:51.720><c> is</c><00:03:51.959><c> more</c><00:03:52.959><c> if</c><00:03:53.079><c> you're</c> this is their approach is more if you're this is their approach is more if you're building<00:03:53.879><c> something</c><00:03:54.560><c> for</c><00:03:55.400><c> an</c><00:03:55.640><c> industry</c><00:03:56.439><c> or</c><00:03:56.640><c> an</c> building something for an industry or an building something for an industry or an application<00:03:57.840><c> which</c><00:03:58.239><c> they</c><00:03:58.439><c> consider</c><00:03:58.799><c> as</c><00:03:58.959><c> being</c> application which they consider as being application which they consider as being high<00:03:59.439><c> risk</c> high risk high risk then<00:04:00.560><c> it</c><00:04:00.680><c> will</c><00:04:00.879><c> be</c><00:04:01.079><c> subject</c><00:04:01.439><c> to</c><00:04:01.760><c> like</c><00:04:01.879><c> more</c> then it will be subject to like more then it will be subject to like more scrutiny<00:04:03.480><c> so</c><00:04:03.680><c> the</c><00:04:03.840><c> idea</c><00:04:04.239><c> here</c><00:04:04.480><c> is</c><00:04:04.840><c> it's</c><00:04:05.040><c> more</c> scrutiny so the idea here is it's more scrutiny so the idea here is it's more just<00:04:05.480><c> around</c><00:04:05.920><c> risk</c><00:04:06.239><c> assessments</c><00:04:06.840><c> I</c><00:04:06.959><c> would</c><00:04:07.200><c> say</c> just around risk assessments I would say just around risk assessments I would say um<00:04:08.560><c> so</c><00:04:09.519><c> essentially</c><00:04:10.000><c> these</c><00:04:10.200><c> AI</c><00:04:10.560><c> developers</c><00:04:11.159><c> on</c> um so essentially these AI developers on um so essentially these AI developers on the<00:04:11.400><c> developer</c><00:04:11.920><c> side</c><00:04:12.319><c> would</c><00:04:12.519><c> need</c><00:04:12.680><c> to</c> the developer side would need to the developer side would need to implement<00:04:13.599><c> these</c><00:04:13.840><c> risk</c><00:04:14.159><c> management</c><00:04:14.760><c> systems</c> implement these risk management systems implement these risk management systems and<00:04:15.840><c>

so they don't want fully autonomous<00:04:35.520><c> systems</c><00:04:36.280><c> they</c><00:04:36.440><c> want</c><00:04:36.720><c> someone</c><00:04:37.120><c> who</c> autonomous systems they want someone who autonomous systems they want someone who is<00:04:37.800><c> kind</c><00:04:37.960><c> of</c><00:04:38.320><c> keeping</c><00:04:38.600><c> an</c><00:04:38.759><c> eye</c><00:04:38.919><c> on</c><00:04:39.080><c> that</c><00:04:39.240><c> or</c><00:04:39.440><c> a</c> is kind of keeping an eye on that or a is kind of keeping an eye on that or a human<00:04:40.440><c> in</c><00:04:40.560><c> the</c><00:04:40.720><c> loop</c><00:04:41.400><c> um</c><00:04:41.600><c> it's</c><00:04:41.800><c> called</c> human in the loop um it's called human in the loop um it's called sometimes<00:04:43.600><c> so</c><00:04:44.160><c> um</c><00:04:44.320><c> the</c><00:04:44.440><c> idea</c><00:04:44.800><c> here</c><00:04:44.960><c> is</c><00:04:45.160><c> around</c> sometimes so um the idea here is around sometimes so um the idea here is around more<00:04:46.360><c> audit</c><00:04:47.360><c> an</c><00:04:47.520><c> approach</c><00:04:47.800><c> for</c><00:04:48.039><c> being</c> more audit an approach for being more audit an approach for being audited<00:04:49.960><c> so</c><00:04:51.000><c> um</c><00:04:52.000><c> yeah</c><00:04:52.199><c> there's</c><00:04:52.479><c> like</c><00:04:53.440><c> some</c> audited so um yeah there's like some audited so um yeah there's like some very<00:04:54.039><c> high</c><00:04:54.240><c> fines</c><00:04:54.720><c> here</c><00:04:54.840><c> for</c><00:04:55.160><c> non-compliance</c> very high fines here for non-compliance very high fines here for non-compliance so<00:04:56.759><c> 35</c><00:04:57.320><c> million</c><00:04:57.639><c> or</c><00:04:57.800><c> 7%</c><00:04:58.320><c> of</c><00:04:58.479><c> global</c><00:04:58.960><c> Revenue</c> so 35 million or 7% of global Revenue so 35 million or 7% of global Revenue and<00:05:00.440><c> I</c><00:05:00.520><c> would</c><00:05:00.720><c> say</c><00:05:01.000><c> generally</c><00:05:01.639><c> I</c><00:05:01.800><c> I</c><00:05:01.880><c> think</c><00:05:02.039><c> that</c> and I would say generally I I think that and I would say generally I I think that the<00:05:02.360><c> key</c><00:05:02.560><c> takeaway</c><00:05:03.039><c> from</c><00:05:03.320><c> this</c><00:05:03.720><c> is</c><00:05:04.000><c> that</c><00:05:04.960><c> this</c> the key takeaway from this is that this the key takeaway from this is that this is<00:05:05.240><c> more</c><00:05:05.520><c> applying</c><00:05:05.960><c> to</c><00:05:06.600><c> Big</c><00:05:06.880><c> tech</c><00:05:07.199><c> companies</c> is more applying to Big tech companies is more applying to Big tech companies who<00:05:07.960><c> are</c><00:05:08.120><c> developing</c><00:05:08.600><c> foundational</c><00:05:09.440><c> models</c> who are developing foundational models who are developing foundational models um<00:05:11.400><c> but</c><00:05:11.680><c> this</c><00:05:11.800><c> doesn't</c><00:05:12.039><c> mean</c><00:05:12.199><c> to</c><00:05:12.360><c> say</c><00:05:12.880><c> things</c> um but this doesn't mean to say things um but this doesn't mean to say things that<00:05:13.360><c> we</c><00:05:13.919><c> develop</c><00:05:14.919><c> um</c><00:05:15.199><c> on</c><00:05:15.400><c> a</c><00:05:16.400><c> more</c><00:05:17.120><c> like</c> that we develop um on a more like that we develop um on a more like smaller<00:05:18.520><c> scale</c><00:05:19.520><c> uh</c><00:05:19.639><c> wouldn't</c><00:05:19.919><c> be</c><00:05:20.120><c> subject</c><00:05:20.520><c> to</c> smaller scale uh wouldn't be

um</c><00:05:24.000><c> but</c><00:05:24.160><c> yeah</c> these these uh the scrutiny um but yeah these these uh the scrutiny um but yeah a<00:05:24.440><c> key</c><00:05:24.639><c> takeaway</c><00:05:25.080><c> is</c><00:05:25.280><c> essentially</c><00:05:25.960><c> that</c><00:05:26.960><c> The</c> a key takeaway is essentially that The a key takeaway is essentially that The

these um technology providers<00:05:42.560><c> need</c><00:05:42.759><c> to</c><00:05:42.919><c> have</c><00:05:43.080><c> this</c> providers need to have this providers need to have this

would</c><00:05:51.039><c> be</c><00:05:51.280><c> a</c><00:05:51.440><c> fine</c><00:05:52.280><c> so</c><00:05:52.400><c> it's</c> that then it would be a fine so it's that then it would be a fine
