we</c> form of function approximation like we form of function approximation like we were<00:14:14.600><c> discussing</c><00:14:15.160><c> earlier</c><00:14:16.000><c> so</c><00:14:16.560><c> uh</c><00:14:16.680><c> within</c> were discussing earlier so uh within were discussing earlier so uh within this<00:14:17.120><c> you</c><00:14:17.240><c> have</c><00:14:17.360><c> deep</c><00:14:17.600><c> learning</c><00:14:17.959><c> Predictive</c> this you have deep learning Predictive this you have deep learning Predictive Analytics<00:14:19.199><c> which</c><00:14:19.320><c> I'll</c><00:14:19.519><c> discuss</c><00:14:19.839><c> a</c><00:14:19.920><c> little</c> Analytics which I'll discuss a little Analytics which I'll discuss a little bit<00:14:20.240><c> more</c><00:14:20.440><c> later</c><00:14:20.839><c> in</c><00:14:20.959><c> this</c> bit more later in this bit more later in this presentation<00:14:23.959><c> but</c><00:14:24.160><c> what</c><00:14:24.360><c> really</c><00:14:24.720><c> is</c><00:14:25.040><c> AI</c><00:14:25.880><c> and</c> presentation but what really is AI and presentation but what really is AI and uh<00:14:26.519><c> I</c><00:14:26.600><c> guess</c><00:14:26.800><c> why</c><00:14:26.920><c> do</c><00:14:27.079><c> so</c><00:14:27.240><c> many</c><00:14:27.440><c> companies</c><00:14:27.839><c> have</c> uh I guess why do so many companies have uh I guess why do so many companies have ai<00:14:28.360><c> in</c><00:14:28.480><c> their</c><00:14:28.639><c> name</c><00:14:29.120><c> even</c><00:14:29.320><c> when</c><00:14:29.480><c> they</c><00:14:29.600><c> don't</c> ai in their name even when they don't ai in their name even when they don't seem<00:14:30.040><c> to</c><00:14:30.240><c> be</c><00:14:30.680><c> obvious</c><00:14:31.199><c> ai</c><00:14:31.880><c> ai</c> seem to be obvious ai ai seem to be obvious ai ai apps<00:14:34.720><c> so</c><00:14:35.279><c> let's</c><00:14:35.720><c> talk</c><00:14:35.920><c> about</c><00:14:36.160><c> what</c><00:14:36.320><c> we</c><00:14:36.560><c> really</c> apps so let's talk about what we really apps so let's talk about what we really mean<00:14:37.320><c> by</c><00:14:37.600><c> data</c><00:14:37.920><c> science</c><00:14:38.440><c> Ai</c><00:14:38.800><c> and</c><00:14:38.959><c> machine</c> mean by data science Ai and machine mean by data science Ai and machine learning<00:14:39.720><c> so</c><00:14:39.839><c> you</c><00:14:40.079><c> often</c><00:14:40.360><c> hear</c><00:14:40.600><c> these</c> learning so you often hear these learning so you often hear these different<00:14:41.199><c> terms</c><00:14:41.720><c> used</c><00:14:42.519><c> interchangeably</c><00:14:43.519><c> so</c> different terms used interchangeably so different terms used interchangeably so what<00:14:43.759><c> we</c><00:14:43.920><c> aim</c><00:14:44.079><c> to</c><00:14:44.199><c> do</c><00:14:44.360><c> here</c><00:14:44.519><c> is</c><00:14:44.720><c> actually</c><00:14:45.000><c> like</c> what we aim to do here is actually like what we aim to do here is actually like clarify<00:14:45.959><c> some</c><00:14:46.120><c> of</c><00:14:46.320><c> these</c><00:14:46.639><c> definitions</c><00:14:47.639><c> so</c> clarify some of these definitions so clarify some of these definitions so when<00:14:47.920><c> you</c><00:14:48.079><c> talk</c><00:14:48.360><c> about</c><00:14:49.040><c> the</c><00:14:49.240><c>

about</c><00:14:50.959><c> data</c><00:14:51.279><c> science</c> you actually talk about data science you actually talk about data science this<00:14:51.959><c> doesn't</c><00:14:52.279><c> just</c><00:14:52.480><c> include</c><00:14:53.240><c> function</c> this doesn't just include function this doesn't just include function approximation<00:14:55.040><c> model</c><00:14:55.839><c>

you</c><00:15:11.240><c> might</c><00:15:11.839><c> choose</c><00:15:12.199><c> a</c><00:15:12.399><c> course</c> at University you might choose a course at University you might choose a course in<00:15:13.160><c> data</c> in data in data science<00:15:15.639><c> uh</c><00:15:15.800><c> AI</c><00:15:16.440><c> actually</c><00:15:16.720><c> sits</c><00:15:17.199><c> within</c><00:15:18.040><c> data</c> science uh AI actually sits within data science uh AI actually sits within data science<00:15:19.240><c> and</c><00:15:19.680><c> its</c><00:15:20.199><c> most</c><00:15:20.480><c> high</c><00:15:20.720><c> level</c> science and its most high level science and its most high level definition<00:15:22.079><c> could</c><00:15:22.320><c> just</c><00:15:22.480><c> be</c><00:15:23.079><c> you</c><00:15:23.199><c> could</c><00:15:23.360><c> say</c> definition could just be you could say definition could just be you could say that<00:15:23.759><c> this</c><00:15:23.880><c> is</c><00:15:24.040><c> a</c><00:15:24.199><c> non-natural</c><00:15:24.959><c> construct</c> that this is a non-natural construct that this is a

in</c><00:15:35.319><c> the</c><00:15:35.440><c> loop</c><00:15:35.959><c> so</c><00:15:36.199><c> you</c> actually involved in the loop so you actually involved in the loop so you have<00:15:36.880><c> a</c><00:15:37.160><c> computer</c><00:15:37.920><c> which</c><00:15:38.040><c> can</c><00:15:38.360><c> exhibit</c><00:15:39.120><c> some</c> have a computer which can exhibit some have a computer which can exhibit some human<00:15:40.920><c> uh</c><00:15:41.839><c> um</c><00:15:42.839><c> humanlike</c><00:15:43.600><c> decision-</c><00:15:44.000><c> making</c> human uh um humanlike decision- making human uh um humanlike decision- making abilities<00:15:45.040><c> but</c><00:15:45.199><c> without</c><00:15:45.399><c> a</c><00:15:45.560><c> human</c><00:15:45.880><c> actually</c> abilities but without a human actually abilities but without a human actually being<00:15:46.519><c> involved</c><00:15:47.120><c> so</c><00:15:47.240><c> this</c><00:15:47.360><c> is</c><00:15:47.480><c> the</c><00:15:47.600><c> most</c><00:15:47.839><c> high</c> being involved so this is the most high being involved so this is the most high level<00:15:48.440><c>

Definition of<00:15:50.839><c> artificial</c><00:15:51.399><c> intelligence</c><00:15:52.240><c> sits</c><00:15:52.519><c> within</c> of artificial intelligence sits within of artificial intelligence sits within data data data science<00:15:55.040><c> however</c><00:15:55.680><c> machine</c><00:15:56.040><c> learning</c><00:15:56.440><c> is</c><00:15:56.639><c> just</c> science however machine learning is just science however machine learning is just one<00:15:57.399><c> approach</c><00:15:58.199><c> to</c><00:15:59.040><c> creating</c><00:15:59.759><c> AI</c><00:16:00.480><c> uh</c> one approach to creating AI uh one approach to creating AI uh algorithms<00:16:01.360><c> it's</c><00:16:01.519><c> just</c><00:16:01.680><c> one</c><00:16:01.839><c> approach</c><00:16:02.600><c> so</c> algorithms it's just one approach so algorithms it's just one approach so there<00:16:03.199><c> are</c><00:16:03.440><c> other</c><00:16:03.880><c> methods</c><00:16:04.279><c> that</c><00:16:04.480><c> exist</c> there are other methods that exist there are other methods that exist things<00:16:05.199><c> like</c><00:16:05.639><c> basian</c><00:16:06.519><c> uh</c><00:16:06.720><c> methods</c><00:16:07.360><c> which</c><00:16:07.480><c> is</c> things like basian uh methods which is things like basian uh methods which is kind<00:16:07.880><c> of</c><00:16:08.160><c> different</c><00:16:08.480><c> to</c><00:16:08.720><c> machine</c><00:16:09.079><c> learning</c> kind of different to machine learning kind of different to machine learning but<00:16:10.040><c> so</c><00:16:10.279><c> machine</c><00:16:10.560><c> learning</c><00:16:10.880><c> is</c><00:16:11.040><c> just</c><00:16:11.240><c> one</c> but so machine learning is just one but so machine learning is just one strand<00:16:12.240><c> of</c><00:16:12.519><c> AI</c><00:16:12.959><c> so</c><00:16:13.120><c> it</c><00:16:13.240><c> sits</c><00:16:13.639><c> again</c><00:16:14.120><c> within</c><00:16:14.480><c> the</c> strand of AI so it sits again within the strand of AI so it sits again within the world<00:16:14.880><c> of</c><00:16:15.120><c> AI</c><00:16:15.639><c> so</c><00:16:16.160><c> when</c><00:16:16.279><c> you</c><00:16:16.440><c> talk</c><00:16:16.720><c> about</c><00:16:17.440><c> uh</c> world of AI so when you talk about uh world of AI so when you talk about uh machine<00:16:17.959><c> learning</c><00:16:18.319><c> just</c><00:16:18.440><c> keep</c><00:16:18.600><c> that</c><00:16:18.720><c> in</c><00:16:18.839><c> mind</c> machine learning just keep that in mind machine learning just keep that in mind it's<00:16:19.240><c> one</c><00:16:19.519><c> field</c><00:16:20.399><c> let's</c><00:16:20.600><c> say</c><00:16:20.920><c> of</c> it's one field let's say of it's one field let's say of AI<00:16:23.440><c> so</c><00:16:23.639><c> yeah</c><00:16:23.800><c> Bas</c><00:16:24.079><c> and</c><00:16:24.199><c> networks</c><00:16:24.600><c> is</c><00:16:24.880><c> another</c> AI so yeah Bas and networks is another AI so yeah Bas and networks is another one<00:16:25.279><c> that</c><00:16:25.399><c> exists</c><00:16:25.959><c> a</c><00:16:26.160><c> very</c><00:16:26.480><c> easy</c><00:16:26.759><c> one</c><00:16:27.000><c> perhaps</c> one that exists a very easy one perhaps one that exists a very easy one perhaps you<00:16:27.639><c> for</c><00:16:27.839><c> people</c><00:16:28.079><c> to</c><00:16:28.519><c> understand</c><00:16:28.720><c> which</c><00:16:28.800><c> is</c> you for people to understand which is you for people to understand which is will<00:16:29.160><c> have</c><00:16:29.279><c> used</c><00:16:29.480><c> a</c><00:16:29.600><c> lot</c><00:16:29.880><c> of</c><00:16:30.399><c> in</c><00:16:30.600><c> engineering</c> will have used a lot of in engineering will have used a lot of in engineering would<00:16:31.639><c> be</c><00:16:31.920><c> like</c><00:16:32.480><c> uh</c><00:16:32.759><c> linearly</c><00:16:33.319><c> squares</c><00:16:34.319><c> um</c><00:16:34.759><c> uh</c> would be like uh linearly squares um uh would be like uh linearly squares um uh squared<00:16:35.759><c> uh</c><00:16:35.959><c> regression</c><00:16:36.600><c> so</c><00:16:36.880><c> linear</c> squared uh regression so linear squared uh regression so linear regression<00:16:37.800><c> essentially</c><00:16:38.360><c> which</c><00:16:38.480><c> is</c><00:16:38.680><c> just</c> regression essentially which is just regression essentially which is just like<00:16:38.959><c> a</c><00:16:39.079><c> line</c><00:16:39.279><c> of</c><00:16:39.480><c> best</c><00:16:39.759><c> fit</c><00:16:40.000><c> through</c> like a line of best fit through like a line of best fit through data<00:16:42.920><c> we</c><00:16:43.120><c> also</c><00:16:43.639><c> have</c><00:16:44.040><c> methods</c><00:16:44.639><c> like</c><00:16:45.240><c> um</c><00:16:45.480><c> deep</c> data we also have methods like um deep data we also have methods like um deep learning<00:16:46.440><c> so</c><00:16:46.720><c> those</c><00:16:47.000><c> sit</c><00:16:47.399><c> within</c><00:16:48.240><c> um</c> learning so those sit within um learning so those sit within um artificial<00:16:49.639><c> artificial</c><00:16:50.160><c> intelligence</c><00:16:50.680><c> and</c> artificial artificial intelligence and artificial artificial intelligence and machine<00:16:51.480><c> learning</c><00:16:52.480><c> and</c><00:16:53.560><c> um</c><00:16:54.560><c> these</c><00:16:54.680><c> are</c> machine learning and um these are machine learning and um these are essentially<00:16:55.440><c> just</c><00:16:56.160><c> uh</c><00:16:57.040><c> neural</c><00:16:57.519><c> networks</c><00:16:57.959><c> that</c> essentially just uh neural networks that essentially just uh neural networks that have<00:16:58.399><c> more</c><00:16:58.600><c> than</c><00:16:58.959><c> two</c><00:16:59.319><c> layers</c><00:16:59.920><c> so</c><00:17:00.160><c> that's</c><00:17:00.360><c> the</c> have more than two layers so that's the have more than two layers so that's the definition<00:17:01.120><c> of</c><00:17:01.399><c> deep</c><00:17:01.639><c> learning</c><00:17:01.959><c> it's</c><00:17:02.160><c> just</c> definition of deep learning it's just definition of deep learning it's just more<00:17:03.279><c> advanced</c><00:17:03.800><c> neural</c> more advanced neural more advanced neural network<00:17:06.600><c> and</c><00:17:07.039><c> artificial</c><00:17:07.559><c> neural</c><00:17:07.919><c> networks</c> network and artificial neural networks network and artificial neural networks are<00:17:08.520><c> just</c><00:17:09.079><c> generic</c><00:17:09.839><c> function</c><00:17:10.600><c> function</c> are just generic function function are just generic function function approximators<00:17:12.480><c> so</c><00:17:12.919><c> this</c><00:17:13.039><c> is</c><00:17:13.520><c> like</c><00:17:13.679><c> the</c><00:17:13.839><c> most</c> approximators so this is like the most approximators so this is like the most highlevel<00:17:14.919><c> uh</c><00:17:15.400><c> definitions</c><00:17:16.400><c> um</c><00:17:16.679><c> but</c><00:17:16.880><c> when</c><00:17:17.000><c> you</c> highlevel uh definitions um but when you highlevel uh definitions um but when you hear<00:17:17.360><c> people</c><00:17:17.679><c> using</c><00:17:18.000><c> them</c><00:17:18.400><c> sometimes</c><00:17:18.559><c> you'll</c> hear people using them sometimes you'll hear people using them sometimes you'll hear<00:17:18.919><c> people</c><00:17:19.199><c> talking</c><00:17:19.600><c> about</c><00:17:19.880><c> it</c> hear people talking about it hear people talking about it interchangeably<00:17:21.400><c> so</c><00:17:21.679><c> here's</c><00:17:22.000><c> how</c><00:17:22.280><c> you</c> interchangeably so here's how you interchangeably so here's how you understand<00:17:23.240><c> it</c><00:17:23.439><c> gets</c><00:17:23.679><c> like</c><00:17:23.799><c> narrower</c><00:17:24.160><c> and</c> understand it gets like narrower and understand it gets like narrower and narrower<00:17:24.799><c> and</c><00:17:24.959><c> how</c><00:17:25.199><c> the</c><00:17:25.799><c> the</c><00:17:26.240><c> the</c><00:17:26.400><c> subjects</c><00:17:27.240><c> um</c> narrower and

other</c> so<00:17:32.440><c> neural</c><00:17:32.880><c> networks</c><00:17:33.280><c> are</c><00:17:33.520><c> one</c><00:17:33.919><c> such</c> so neural networks are one such so neural networks are one such technology<00:17:35.400><c> that</c><00:17:35.559><c> can</c><00:17:35.720><c> be</c><00:17:35.880><c> used</c><00:17:36.160><c> to</c><00:17:36.320><c> build</c><00:17:36.960><c> fun</c> technology that can be used to build fun technology that can be used to build fun function<00:17:37.880><c> approximators</c><00:17:38.840><c> and</c><00:17:38.919><c> we're</c><00:17:39.039><c> going</c> function approximators and we're going function approximators and we're going to<00:17:39.280><c> talk</c><00:17:39.440><c> a</c><00:17:39.559><c> little</c><00:17:39.760><c>

so</c><00:17:41.679><c> the</c><00:17:41.880><c> key</c><00:17:42.080><c> thing</c><00:17:42.360><c> here</c><00:17:42.919><c> is</c><00:17:43.240><c> as</c><00:17:43.320><c> I</c><00:17:43.440><c> was</c> here so the key thing here is as I was here so the key thing here is as I was mentioning<00:17:44.039><c> before</c><00:17:44.480><c> around</c><00:17:45.200><c> back</c> mentioning before around back mentioning before around back propagation<00:17:46.480><c> but</c><00:17:46.600><c> we</c><00:17:46.760><c> actually</c><00:17:47.120><c> have</c><00:17:47.520><c> before</c> propagation

back</c><00:17:52.640><c> propagation</c><00:17:53.600><c> the</c><00:17:53.760><c> key</c> and um then back propagation the key and um then back propagation the key thing<00:17:54.080><c> to</c><00:17:54.280><c> think</c><00:17:54.480><c> about</c><00:17:54.799><c> here</c><00:17:55.000><c> in</c><00:17:55.159><c> terms</c><00:17:55.440><c> of</c> thing to think about here in terms of

so</c><00:19:49.080><c> many</c><00:19:49.240><c> companies</c> why do why are there so many companies why do why are there so many companies that<00:19:49.760><c> say</c><00:19:50.120><c> about</c><00:19:50.440><c> using</c><00:19:50.799><c> AI</c><00:19:51.159><c> but</c><00:19:51.240><c> it's</c><00:19:51.400><c> not</c><00:19:51.559><c> so</c> that say about using AI but it's not so that say about using AI but it's not so obvious<00:19:52.080><c> what</c><00:19:52.200><c> they're</c><00:19:52.360><c> doing</c><00:19:53.120><c> a</c><00:19:53.280><c> lot</c><00:19:53.440><c>

more</c> most of AI in the past has been more most of AI in the past has been more like<00:20:24.720><c> this</c><00:20:25.080><c> classical</c><00:20:26.080><c> um</c><00:20:26.640><c> classical</c><00:20:27.120><c> machine</c> like this classical um classical machine like this classical um classical machine learning learning learning then<00:20:29.679><c> what</c><00:20:29.799><c> you</c><00:20:30.039><c> have</c><00:20:30.400><c> is</c><00:20:31.000><c> um</c><00:20:31.320><c> so</c><00:20:31.600><c> so</c><00:20:31.799><c> you</c><00:20:31.960><c> could</c> then what you have is um so so you could then what you have is um so so you could perhaps<00:20:33.000><c> use</c><00:20:33.240><c> classical</c><00:20:33.640><c> machine</c><00:20:33.919><c> learning</c> perhaps use classical machine learning perhaps use classical machine learning for<00:20:34.600><c> something</c><00:20:34.960><c> like</c><00:20:35.400><c> predicting</c><00:20:36.240><c> uh</c><00:20:36.400><c> future</c> for something like predicting uh future for something like predicting uh future data<00:20:37.880><c> so</c><00:20:38.120><c> taking</c><00:20:38.440><c> things</c><00:20:38.720><c> like</c><00:20:38.960><c> Trends</c><00:20:39.440><c> stock</c> data so taking things like Trends stock data so taking things like Trends stock market<00:20:40.440><c> prices</c><00:20:40.919><c> something</c><00:20:41.200><c> like</c><00:20:41.400><c> this</c><00:20:41.640><c> and</c> market prices something like this and market prices something like this and trying<00:20:42.000><c> to</c><00:20:42.159><c> predict</c><00:20:42.520><c> Trends</c><00:20:43.120><c> or</c><00:20:43.480><c> future</c> trying to predict Trends or future trying to predict Trends or future patterns<00:20:45.320><c> so</c><00:20:45.679><c> this</c><00:20:45.799><c> could</c><00:20:45.960><c> be</c><00:20:46.120><c> one</c><00:20:46.280><c> such</c><00:20:46.520><c> use</c> patterns so this could be one such use patterns so this could be one such use case<00:20:46.960><c> but</c><00:20:47.080><c> there's</c><00:20:47.320><c> many</c><00:20:48.000><c> um</c><00:20:48.880><c> for</c><00:20:49.480><c> deep</c><00:20:49.960><c> neural</c> case but there's many um for deep neural case but there's many um for deep neural networks<00:20:51.400><c> so</c><00:20:51.640><c> these</c><00:20:52.159><c> typically</c><00:20:52.640><c> power</c><00:20:53.039><c> text</c> networks so these typically power text networks so these typically power text to<00:20:53.520><c>

some foundational aspects of machine<00:26:32.320><c> learning</c><00:26:33.320><c> so</c><00:26:33.520><c> what</c><00:26:33.600><c> you</c><00:26:33.720><c> see</c><00:26:34.000><c> here</c><00:26:34.200><c> is</c> machine learning so what you see here is machine learning so what you see here is a<00:26:34.600><c> chart</c><00:26:35.480><c> linking</c><00:26:36.200><c> um</c><00:26:36.399><c> this</c><00:26:36.520><c> is</c><00:26:36.640><c> actually</c><00:26:36.840><c> for</c> a chart linking um this is actually for a chart linking um this is actually for
