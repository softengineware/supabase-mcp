artificial general<00:00:23.920><c> intelligence</c><00:00:24.920><c> so</c><00:00:25.119><c> what</c><00:00:25.279><c> is</c> general intelligence so what is general intelligence so what is artificial<00:00:26.080><c> general</c><00:00:26.439><c> intelligence</c><00:00:27.279><c> so</c><00:00:27.439><c> we'll</c> artificial general intelligence so we'll artificial general intelligence so we'll come<00:00:27.800><c> over</c><00:00:27.960><c> to</c><00:00:28.160><c> Wikipedia</c><00:00:28.800><c> and</c><00:00:28.920><c> have</c><00:00:29.039><c> a</c><00:00:29.160><c> look</c> come over to Wikipedia and have a look come over to Wikipedia and have a look at<00:00:29.439><c> what</c><00:00:29.560><c> this</c><00:00:29.679><c> means</c> at what this means at what this means

of capabilities across a wide range of cognitive<00:00:40.760><c> tasks</c><00:00:41.760><c> so</c><00:00:42.079><c> not</c><00:00:42.239><c> only</c><00:00:42.559><c> does</c><00:00:42.800><c> it</c><00:00:43.320><c> is</c> cognitive tasks so not only does it is cognitive tasks so not only does it is it<00:00:43.600><c> able</c><00:00:43.840><c> to</c><00:00:44.039><c> perform</c><00:00:44.600><c> many</c><00:00:44.920><c> different</c><00:00:45.280><c> tasks</c> it able to perform many different tasks it able to perform many different tasks but<00:00:46.199><c> it</c><00:00:46.320><c> can</c><00:00:46.520><c> actually</c><00:00:46.840><c> outperform</c><00:00:47.559><c> us</c><00:00:47.800><c> as</c> but it can actually outperform us as but it can actually outperform us as humans<00:00:49.239><c> so</c><00:00:49.480><c> what</c><00:00:49.600><c> we</c><00:00:49.719><c> have</c><00:00:49.920><c> today</c><00:00:50.480><c> with</c><00:00:50.680><c> a</c><00:00:50.800><c> lot</c> humans so what we have today with a lot humans so what we have today with a lot of<00:00:51.039><c> the</c><00:00:51.199><c> foundational</c><00:00:51.840><c>

is<00:01:09.119><c> really</c><00:01:09.400><c> saying</c><00:01:09.840><c> is</c><00:01:09.960><c> that</c><00:01:10.119><c> artificial</c> is really saying is that artificial is really saying is that artificial general<00:01:10.880><c> intelligence</c><00:01:11.600><c> won't</c><00:01:11.880><c> just</c><00:01:12.000><c> be</c><00:01:12.119><c> able</c> general intelligence won't just be able general intelligence won't just be able to<00:01:12.400><c> do</c><00:01:12.560><c> this</c><00:01:12.720><c> but</c><00:01:12.799><c> it'll</c><00:01:13.000><c> be</c><00:01:13.240><c> able</c><00:01:13.400><c> to</c><00:01:13.520><c> do</c><00:01:13.680><c> this</c> to do this but it'll be able to do this to do this but it'll be able to do this much<00:01:14.119><c> better</c><00:01:14.439><c> than</c><00:01:14.640><c> we</c><00:01:14.840><c> can</c><00:01:15.080><c> it'll</c><00:01:15.240><c> be</c><00:01:15.360><c> able</c><00:01:15.479><c> to</c> much better than we can it'll be able to much better than we can it'll be able to find<00:01:16.040><c> and</c><00:01:16.479><c> understand</c><00:01:16.759><c> things</c><00:01:17.560><c>

it<00:01:38.880><c> hasn't</c><00:01:39.119><c> even</c><00:01:39.399><c> had</c><00:01:39.640><c> that</c><00:01:39.799><c> many</c><00:01:40.040><c> views</c><00:01:40.520><c> I</c> it hasn't even had that many views I it hasn't even had that many views I would<00:01:40.799><c> say</c><00:01:41.200><c> uh</c><00:01:41.320><c> open</c><00:01:41.600><c> AI</c><00:01:42.360><c> announced</c><00:01:42.840><c> that</c> would say uh open AI announced that would say uh open AI announced that they're<00:01:43.159><c> releasing</c><00:01:43.799><c> this</c><00:01:44.040><c> 03</c><00:01:44.719><c> and</c><00:01:44.880><c> 03</c><00:01:45.280><c> Mini</c> they're releasing this 03 and 03 Mini they're releasing this 03 and 03 Mini model<00:01:46.759><c> so</c><00:01:46.960><c> this</c><00:01:47.079><c> was</c><00:01:47.280><c> back</c><00:01:47.479><c> in</c><00:01:48.079><c> January</c> model so this was back in January model so this was back in January December<00:01:48.960><c> time</c><00:01:49.600><c> that</c><00:01:49.759><c> they</c><00:01:49.920><c> started</c><00:01:50.280><c> to</c> December time that they started to December time that they started to announce<00:01:51.000><c> this</c><00:01:51.840><c> and</c><00:01:52.079><c> so</c><00:01:52.560><c> why</c><00:01:52.759><c> why</c><00:01:52.880><c> is</c><00:01:53.040><c> this</c> announce this and so why why is this announce this and so why why is this quite<00:01:53.439><c> huge</c><00:01:54.159><c> so</c><00:01:54.360><c> I'm</c><00:01:54.479><c>

state-ofthe-art foundational model before<00:03:05.200><c> 1,800</c><00:03:06.200><c> so</c><00:03:06.599><c> it's</c><00:03:07.280><c> uh</c><00:03:07.440><c> it</c><00:03:07.560><c> wasn't</c><00:03:07.840><c> as</c> before 1,800 so it's uh it wasn't as before 1,800 so it's uh it wasn't as good<00:03:08.080><c> as</c><00:03:08.200><c> them</c><00:03:08.519><c>

the</c><00:05:16.000><c> whole</c><00:05:16.199><c> point</c> unless you reach AGI so the whole point unless you reach AGI so the whole point of<00:05:16.600><c> these</c><00:05:16.800><c> problems</c><00:05:17.160><c> they</c><00:05:17.360><c> create</c><00:05:17.800><c> is</c><00:05:17.880><c> to</c><00:05:18.000><c> try</c> of these problems they create is to try of these problems they create is to try and<00:05:18.280><c> prove</c><00:05:18.600><c> have</c><00:05:18.720><c> we</c><00:05:18.840><c> reached</c><00:05:19.160><c> AGI</c><00:05:19.600><c> or</c><00:05:19.759><c>

you</c><00:05:28.120><c> can</c><00:05:28.240><c> even</c> try and understand maybe you can even try and understand maybe you can even pause<00:05:28.759><c> the</c><00:05:28.919><c> video</c><00:05:29.919><c> the</c><00:05:30.080><c> idea</c><00:05:30.440><c> is</c><00:05:30.639><c> you</c><00:05:30.759><c> have</c><00:05:30.880><c> an</c> pause the video the idea is you have an

an</c><00:05:34.880><c> indication</c><00:05:35.360><c> of</c><00:05:35.639><c> what</c> and that gives you an indication of what and that gives you an indication of what perhaps<00:05:36.919><c> is</c><00:05:37.560><c> the</c><00:05:37.960><c> algorithm</c><00:05:38.479><c> or</c><00:05:38.639><c> the</c><00:05:38.720><c> way</c><00:05:38.840><c> to</c> perhaps is the algorithm or the way to perhaps is the algorithm or the way to solve<00:05:39.319><c> the</c><00:05:39.520><c> problem</c><00:05:40.360><c> if</c><00:05:40.440><c> you</c><00:05:40.560><c> look</c><00:05:40.680><c> at</c><00:05:40.840><c> this</c> solve the problem if you look at this solve the problem if you look at this test<00:05:41.319><c> input</c><00:05:41.759><c> then</c><00:05:42.039><c> you</c><00:05:42.240><c> provide</c><00:05:42.560><c> this</c><00:05:42.680><c> to</c><00:05:42.800><c> the</c> test input then you provide this to the test input then you provide this to the AG<00:05:43.479><c> uh</c><00:05:43.600><c> to</c><00:05:43.720><c> the</c><00:05:44.039><c> AI</c><00:05:45.039><c> and</c><00:05:45.160><c> then</c><00:05:45.280><c> you</c><00:05:45.400><c> say</c><00:05:45.800><c> what's</c> AG uh to the AI and then you say what's AG uh to the AI and then you say what's the<00:05:46.120><c> output</c><00:05:46.520><c> probably</c><00:05:46.800><c> going</c><00:05:46.880><c> to</c><00:05:47.039><c> be</c><00:05:47.639><c> so</c><00:05:47.919><c> if</c> the output probably going to be so if the output probably going to be so if you<00:05:48.120><c> look</c><00:05:48.240><c> at</c><00:05:48.360><c> this</c><00:05:48.479><c> for</c><00:05:48.600><c> a</c><00:05:48.759><c> while</c><00:05:49.479><c> you'll</c> you look at this for a while you'll you look at this for a while you'll probably<00:05:50.360><c> start</c><00:05:50.600><c> to</c><00:05:50.840><c> realize</c><00:05:51.440><c> perhaps</c><00:05:51.720><c> it's</c> probably start to realize perhaps it's probably start to realize perhaps it's the<00:05:52.319><c> blue</c><00:05:53.319><c> uh</c><00:05:53.440><c> the</c><00:05:53.600><c> darker</c><00:05:53.960><c> blue</c><00:05:54.319><c> color</c><00:05:54.680><c> gets</c> the blue uh the darker blue color gets the blue uh the darker blue color gets filled<00:05:55.199><c> in</c><00:05:55.440><c> where</c><00:05:55.600><c> you</c><00:05:55.759><c> have</c><00:05:55.960><c> these</c><00:05:56.199><c> gaps</c> filled in where you have these gaps filled in where you have these gaps present<00:05:57.400><c> so</c><00:05:57.560><c> the</c><00:05:57.720><c> actual</c><00:05:58.039><c> solution</c><00:05:58.479><c> to</c><00:05:58.720><c> this</c> present so the actual solution to this present so the actual solution to this is<00:05:59.080><c> basically</c><00:05:59.440><c> just</c><00:05:59.639><c> just</c><00:05:59.720><c> filling</c><00:06:00.039><c> dark</c><00:06:00.319><c> blue</c> is basically just just filling dark blue is basically just just filling dark blue into<00:06:01.080><c> these</c><00:06:01.919><c> empty</c><00:06:02.880><c> empty</c><00:06:03.240><c> squares</c><00:06:03.800><c> here</c><00:06:04.759><c> this</c> into these empty empty squares here this into these empty empty squares here this is<00:06:05.120><c> typically</c><00:06:05.600><c> very</c><00:06:05.880><c> hard</c><00:06:06.120><c> for</c><00:06:06.319><c> an</c><00:06:06.520><c> AI</c><00:06:07.160><c> to</c> is typically very hard for an AI to is typically very hard for an AI to understand<00:06:08.080><c> because</c><00:06:08.840><c> each</c><00:06:09.039><c> one</c><00:06:09.240><c> of</c><00:06:09.400><c> these</c> understand because each one of these understand because each one of these problems<00:06:10.319><c> is</c><00:06:11.120><c> unique</c><00:06:12.120><c> each</c><00:06:12.280><c> one</c><00:06:12.520><c> requires</c> problems is unique each one requires problems is unique each one requires different<00:06:13.240><c> skills</c><00:06:13.680><c> and</c><00:06:13.800><c> they're</c><00:06:14.000><c> never</c> different skills and they're never different skills and they're never replicated<00:06:15.280><c> they're</c><00:06:15.520><c> never</c><00:06:16.160><c> they're</c><00:06:16.360><c> never</c> replicated they're never they're never replicated they're never they're never copied<00:06:17.680><c> so</c><00:06:17.880><c> here's</c><00:06:18.160><c> another</c><00:06:18.440><c> one</c><00:06:19.240><c> uh</c><00:06:19.440><c> and</c><00:06:19.840><c> yeah</c> copied so here's another one uh and yeah copied so here's another one uh and yeah the<00:06:20.280><c> idea</c><00:06:20.680><c> here</c><00:06:20.919><c> is</c><00:06:21.240><c> you</c><00:06:21.400><c> kind</c><00:06:21.520><c> of</c><00:06:21.759><c> count</c><00:06:22.199><c> the</c> the idea here is you kind of count the the idea here is you kind of count the width<00:06:22.840><c> of</c><00:06:23.199><c> the</c><00:06:24.160><c> the</c><00:06:24.440><c> outside</c><00:06:25.440><c> uh</c><00:06:25.599><c> the</c><00:06:25.759><c> W</c><00:06:26.479><c> the</c> width of the the outside uh the W the width of the the outside uh the W the extreme<00:06:27.479><c> width</c><00:06:28.080><c> of</c><00:06:28.240><c> the</c><00:06:28.360><c> outside</c><00:06:28.840><c> and</c><00:06:28.919><c> then</c> extreme width of the outside and then extreme width of the outside and then use<00:06:29.240><c> that</c><00:06:29.319><c> to</c><00:06:29.599><c> color</c><00:06:29.880><c> the</c><00:06:30.000><c> outside</c><00:06:30.440><c> of</c><00:06:30.639><c> the</c> use that to color the outside of the use that to color the outside of the squares<00:06:31.759><c> so</c><00:06:32.000><c> again</c><00:06:32.280><c> this</c><00:06:32.360><c> is</c><00:06:32.599><c> like</c><00:06:32.800><c> a</c> squares so again this is like a squares so again this is like a different<00:06:33.479><c> problem</c><00:06:34.039><c> to</c><00:06:34.199><c> the</c><00:06:34.319><c> one</c><00:06:34.560><c> which</c><00:06:34.680><c> was</c> different problem to the one which was different problem to the one which was just<00:06:35.360><c> solved</c><00:06:36.360><c> um</c><00:06:37.039><c> so</c><00:06:37.560><c> each</c><00:06:37.840><c> each</c><00:06:38.000><c> one</c><00:06:38.120><c> of</c><00:06:38.240><c> these</c> just solved um so each each one of these just solved um so each each one of these is<00:06:38.680><c> unique</c><00:06:39.599><c> uh</c><00:06:39.680><c> in</c><00:06:39.800><c> its</c><00:06:40.000><c> own</c><00:06:40.319><c> right</c><00:06:41.039><c> and</c> is unique uh in its own right and is unique uh in its own right and therefore<00:06:41.759><c> you</c><00:06:41.880><c> can't</c><00:06:42.120><c> really</c><00:06:42.360><c> train</c><00:06:42.720><c> like</c><00:06:42.840><c> an</c> therefore you can't really train like an therefore you can't really train like an AI<00:06:43.440><c> to</c><00:06:43.599><c> be</c><00:06:43.720><c> able</c><00:06:44.000><c> to</c><00:06:44.919><c> just</c><00:06:45.560><c> copy</c><00:06:45.880><c> these</c><00:06:46.039><c> and</c> AI to be able to just copy these and AI to be able to just copy these and replicate<00:06:46.680><c> it</c><00:06:47.400><c> because</c><00:06:48.400><c> each</c><00:06:48.680><c> one</c><00:06:49.080><c> it</c><00:06:49.240><c> will</c> replicate it because each one it will replicate it because each one it will have<00:06:49.560><c> never</c><00:06:49.720><c> seen</c><00:06:50.199><c>

03</c><00:07:29.759><c> series</c><00:07:30.479><c> you'll</c> now if you look at this 03 series you'll now if you look at this 03 series you'll see<00:07:30.919><c> it's</c><00:07:31.080><c> all</c><00:07:31.199><c> the</c><00:07:31.319><c> way</c><00:07:31.440><c> up</c><00:07:31.599><c> at</c> see it's all the way up at see it's all the way up at 87.5%<00:07:33.400><c> of</c><00:07:33.560><c> these</c><00:07:33.840><c> problems</c><00:07:34.240><c> which</c><00:07:34.400><c> can</c><00:07:34.560><c> be</c> 87.5% of these problems which can be 87.5% of these problems which can be solved<00:07:35.440><c> so</c><00:07:35.720><c> those</c><00:07:35.879><c> two</c><00:07:36.120><c> I</c><00:07:36.240><c> just</c><00:07:36.360><c> showed</c><00:07:36.599><c> you</c>

solve</c><00:07:38.800><c> one</c><00:07:38.960><c> of</c> that's two problems you solve one of that's two problems you solve one of them<00:07:39.280><c> you</c><00:07:39.360><c> get</c><00:07:39.520><c> 50%</c><00:07:40.120><c> you</c><00:07:40.240><c> solve</c><00:07:40.520><c> both</c><00:07:40.680><c> of</c><00:07:40.759><c> them</c> them you get 50% you solve both of them them you get 50% you solve both of them you<00:07:41.000><c> get</c><00:07:41.199><c> 100%</c><00:07:42.039><c> so</c><00:07:42.400><c> that's</c><00:07:42.599><c> the</c><00:07:42.720><c> way</c><00:07:42.960><c> this</c> you get 100% so that's the way this you get 100% so that's the way this works<00:07:43.879><c> and</c><00:07:44.039><c> you'll</c><00:07:44.199><c>

of<00:07:45.840><c> this</c><00:07:46.039><c> 03</c><00:07:46.560><c> model</c><00:07:46.919><c> can</c><00:07:47.039><c> solve</c> of this 03 model can solve of this 03 model can solve 87.5%<00:07:49.120><c> this</c><00:07:49.240><c> is</c><00:07:49.720><c> really</c><00:07:50.720><c> important</c><00:07:51.639><c> because</c> 87.5% this is really important because 87.5% this is

these</c><00:07:56.440><c> so</c> humans can solve around 85% of these so humans can solve around 85% of these so your<00:07:57.280><c> definition</c><00:07:57.759><c> of</c><00:07:57.919><c>

out</c><00:12:47.800><c> of</c><00:12:47.920><c> 10</c><00:12:48.399><c> so</c><00:12:48.920><c> yeah</c><00:12:49.320><c> and</c><00:12:49.440><c> then</c><00:12:49.720><c> the</c> 10 uh 8.5 out of 10 so yeah and then the 10 uh 8.5 out of 10 so yeah and then the idea<00:12:50.279><c> here</c><00:12:50.480><c> is</c><00:12:50.680><c> I</c><00:12:50.760><c> can</c><00:12:50.959><c>
